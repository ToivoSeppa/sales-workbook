# sales-workbook
A Google Sheets workbook made as part of the Google Sheets for Data Analytics-module in kodree.com. It contains tables and visualizations of the sales of a fictional company.

The project was started from this zip-file:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c4n_5ooeBfPJfr6QqblfK-CwRvy_a4CI/view
The zip-file contains three files: events.csv, products.csv and countries.csv.

###In this project:
I downloaded and imported the data.
I analyzed the quality and integrity of the data, removing missing data.
Calculated the total revenue, cost and profit for each order.
Identified key business metrics such as volume of orders, total profit and countries covered.
Created tables and visualizations for different metrics and used them to identify trends.
Performed an ABC-analysis, categorizing products based on total profit.
Wrote a report with my findings.
